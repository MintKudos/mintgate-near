# MintGate

## Quickstart

If you don't have Rust:

Install Rust <https://rustup.rs/>

Add `wasm32` target to Rust

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

**Check for Rust version 1.51.0**.
To compile the simulation tests `mg-sim`, make sure to have at least Rust 1.51.0.
The `mg-sim` tests depend indirectly on the `arrayvec` library.
This library in [`v0.7.0`](https://github.com/bluss/arrayvec/pull/172)
uses a Rust feature available from 1.51.0,
[const generics](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/03/25/Rust-1.51.0.html#const-generics-mvp).
You can check Rust version with `rustc --version`.
If an update is needed, run

```sh
rustup update stable
```

### Install `near-ts` and `near-md` (optional)

`near-ts` is a utility to generate TypeScript bindings from a Rust contract.
On the other hand, `near-md` is a utility to generate Markdown documentation from a Rust contract.
You can install it with

```sh
cargo install near-syn
```

Or alternatively you can install it directly from GitHub

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/epam/near-syn --branch main
```

## To Explore

- [`mg-nft` contract](mg-nft/)
- [`mg-market` contract](mg-market/)

## Scripts

The `package.json` contains scripts to facilitate running compilation targets and tests.
The following are the most relevant scripts.

- `build:contracts`.
Builds both `mg_nft.wasm` and `mg_market.wasm` contracts for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.
The wasm binaries can be found under `release/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` folder.
- `unit-test:contracts`.
Runs both `mg-nft` and `mg-market` contract unit tests.
These tests are being executed locally using the host architecture.
In other words, they are not compile down to WebAssembly.
- `app-test:contracts`.
Executes the application tests.
The application tests run both contracts in `testnet`.
It creates user and contract accounts to test the contracts.
The accounts IDs used are cached in the `neardev` folder.
Moreover, the script automatically deploys contracts to the `testnet` contract accounts.
It ensures that both contracts are already built before running the tests.
- `app-test:contracts:clean`.
Removes the `neardev` folder which contains the account IDs created for `app-test:contracts`.
- `ts:contracts`.
Generates both `mg-nft` and `mg-market` contracts TypeScript bindings in `src` folder.
The `near-ts` utility (from `near-syn` package) needs to be installed to execute this script.
- `md:contracts`.
Generates both `mg-nft` and `mg-market` contracts documentation `README.md` in their respective folders.
The `near-md` utility (from `near-syn` package) needs to be installed to execute this script.
- `dev-deploy:contract`.
*WIP*. Deploys contracts to a dev account.
- `deploy:contract`.
*WIP*. Deploys contracts to an already logged in account.
- `build:lib`.
Builds the contract client library.
- `lint:lib`.
Provides linting checks for the contract client library.
- `measure:storage-costs`.
Performs an arbitrary number of operations for `collectibles` and `tokens` on `nft-contract` and `market-contract`. 
Collects the information on how much Ⓝ reserved for storage. Generates `data.js` file in `tests` folder.

## Terminology

- **User**: any Internet user who may (or may not) have NEAR Account
- **NEAR User**: a User who has NEAR Account
- **Creator (aka Artist)**: a User who has NEAR Account and MintGate account. Creator creates Collectibles. Creator cannot be changed once set for Collectible.
- **Admin**: a NEAR User that operates MintGate NFT contract, or another NEAR Account that takes this role as assigned during build and deployment process of NFT contract.
- **Claimer (aka Holder)**: a NEAR User who mints Tokens for selected Collectible on the NFT contract. Creator and Admin also can act as a Claimer. Claimer becomes an Owner after s_he successfully minted a Token.
- **Buyer**: a NEAR User who purchases Token from Marketplace. Buyer becomes an Owner after s_he successfully purchased a Token.
- **Seller**: an Owner who sells Token on the Marketplace from the moment when he approves Marketplace until deal will be settled, and he looses ownership over a Token.
- **Owner**: a NEAR User who owns a Token of any Collectible as a result of minting it on NFT contract, buying from Marketplace, or receiving it as a gift from another Owner.
- **Royalty beneficiary**: a NEAR User who receives % from each deal closed on any of the Marketplaces with each Token. There will be exactly 1 Royalty beneficiary. It may be a Creator, but may be not. Royalty beneficiary cannot be changed once set for Collectible.
- **Collectible**: NFT with information about its Creator, Supply and other Metadata, identified uniquely by GateID provided externally from MintGate platform.
- **GateID**: unique identifier of Collectible that originally generated by MintGate and stored in their master database off-chain.
- **Supply**: maximum amount of Tokens that can be minted for given Collectible. Minimum supply is 1 ("Pure NFT"). When NFT has Supply > 1, it can be named a semi-fungible Token.
- **Current Supply**: number of remaining Tokens available for minting for given Collectible. Current Supply <= Supply, and always decreasing towards 0. When CurrentSupply=0 then Tokens for this Collectible can be obtained from Marketplace, or as a result of direct transfer from Owner to NEAR User (as a gift or a deal settled off-chain).  
- **Token**: an asset on NFT Contract that is identified by unique ID and that always belongs to one Collectible and has one Owner.

## Storage Costs

`measure:storage-costs` script measures the costs of storage for `nft-contract` and `market-contract`. It performs operations on `collectibles` and `tokens` on the contracts, collects the information on changes in Ⓝ reserved for storage for different methods.

By default, `measure:storage-costs` adds 20 `collectibes` and 40 `tokens` for test account (it reuses already present accounts or creates new ones and deploys contracts if needed).

It is also possible to instruct the script to add the arbitrary number of `collectibles` and `tokens`.

To do so run from project's root:
```
ts-node test/measure.ts --collectibles 100 -- tokens 200
``` 
where:
- `--collectibles`: number of collectibles to add. Number of times `create_collectible`, `delete_collectible` will be executed.
- `--tokens`: number of tokens to add. `claim_token`, `nft_transfer`, `nft_approve`, `batch_approve`, `nft_revoke`, `buy_token` will be executed for this number of tokens.

The script generates `data.js` file in `tests` folder. The information from `data.js` as datasets for charts in `chart.html` file also located in `tests` folder. To see the charts open `chart.html` in any browser.

Example of storage costs charts with data generated by running `measure` script with default values:
